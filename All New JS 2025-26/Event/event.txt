Key Difference:() => {} ignores the Event object, limiting you to actions that don’t require event-specific data.
(e) => {} captures the Event object, enabling access to its properties and methods for more complex interactions.



 Why Use e?
 The Event object (e) is essential when you need to:Access Event Details:Identify the element that triggered the event (e.target).
Get event-specific data like mouse coordinates (e.clientX, e.clientY) or key pressed (e.key).
Example: Log which button was clicked in a group of buttons.

Control Event Behavior:Prevent default actions (e.preventDefault()), e.g., stopping a form submission.
Stop event propagation (e.stopPropagation()), e.g., preventing a parent handler from firing.
Example: Prevent a link from navigating to a URL.

Implement Event Delegation:Use e.target to handle events on child elements via a parent listener.
Example: Handle clicks on dynamically added list items.

Access Modifier Keys or Event Context:Check if Ctrl, Shift, or Alt was pressed (e.ctrlKey, e.shiftKey, e.altKey).
Example: Detect a Ctrl + Click action.

If the handler doesn’t need these details (e.g., just updating a counter or toggling a state), you can omit e for cleaner code.
